# TwisterMaze
Played entirely on the terminal, TwisterMaze is a minigame in which 2 players try and reach 2 doors, 
one each, while the keys that make them move switch every time they step on a "?" sign. 
Ah, there's also a countdown.

Basically, after one of you steps on a switch, the key that makes you go up could stay the same or switch with
the one that makes the other player go up. And the same stands for all 4 keys.
